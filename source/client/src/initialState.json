Australia Day, on January 26 each year, is commemorated as Invasion Day by many indigenous Australians. In 2009, it coincided with Lunar New Year, celebrated by many Asian cultures.

Police arrested at least five people in a Noosaville park with another unit needing backup at Gympie Terrace (Noosa).

The virus has infected one out of every 3,000 computers of the 5,500,000 million which the company monitors in the United States and the United Kingdom. The trojan can infect users of Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Internet Explorer on Microsoft Windows, and steals login information by recording keystrokes when the machine connects to certain websites, usually banks or other financial institutions. The stolen data is transmitted to a remote server and sold to cyber-criminals. \"We expect this new version of Zeus to significantly increase fraud losses, since nearly 30% of Internet users bank online with Firefox and the infection is growing faster than we have ever seen before,\" said Amit Klein, chief technology officer at Trusteer, to BBC. The trojan has also affected Wikinews users, including Brian McNeil, who is the founder of Wikinewsie, a restricted-access wiki used to collaborate on sensitive news reports. McNeil reported on his userspace: \"On Saturday [April] 17, a Windows-based PC in the house issued a cry for help, the Avira package running on the system had just detected a piece of malware; full scans indicated several known pieces of malware and numerous hidden files.

The alert level has been raised to the highest level, warning of an imminent eruption of the volcano which has been rumbling for weeks and spewing lavas and black ash.    France The French daily Le Monde, which has a tradition of publishing full texts by politicians and intellectuals, was one of the first organisations to publish the full English text of Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's letter to US president George W. Bush, on May 9, 2006. On the same day, the US daily the Wall Street Journal published a scan of the English text and the Iranian Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) published the full text. In the UK, the Guardian published the full text two days later.    United States The U.S. Senate has scheduled debate and a vote in June on a bill that would initiate a process for Native Hawaiians to achieve the same level of self-governance and autonomy over their own affairs that many Native American tribes currently have. Senator Daniel Akaka (D-Hawaii), the main proponent of bill S. 147 (the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act) and a Native Hawaiian himself, had been giving daily speeches on the Senate floor in support of the bill since May 9 to raise awareness of the bill.

		   "text":"Saturday, March 26, 2005\u00a0 gghhh      European astronomers discovered a very young and huge star cluster within our Milky Way galaxy using European Southern Observatory telescopes. The discovery was made at the La Silla Observatory in Chile. Hidden behind a veil of dust and gas, the super star cluster, known as Westerlund 1, is 1000 times closer than any other known clusters. These Super star clusters were previously known to exist as pairs or groups of interacting galaxies located at immense intergalactic distances. It is so close--within 10,000 light years--scientists will be able to examine its structure in detail. Until now, super clusters were far too distant for individual stars to be distinguished. Initial observations have led scientists to conclude the group contains at least 100,000 times the mass of the Sun, with some single stars shining with a power of 1,000,000 suns and 2000 times larger than our own. All the stars are in a region less than six light years across. The existence of Westerlund 1's has been known since 1961. Discovered by Swedish astronomer Bengt Westerlund while in Australia, the cluster is located in the Southern constellation Ara (the Altar). It was a dimming factor of more than 100,000 caused by the gas and dust between us and the cluster that prevented the actual structure and nature of the phenomenon to be determined. Using a variety of instruments, including the Wide Field Imager (WFI) attached to a 2.2 meter scope and the Superb-Seeing Imager 2 (SuSI2) camera on the ESO 3.5 meter New Technology Telescope (NTT), 200 cluster member stars were identified. These and other observations have revealed the cluster contains young stars on the order of 30-40 times more massive than our own Sun. The age range has been determined at 3.5 to five million years old, making this cluster very young compared to the Galaxy itself at around 13.5 billion years. The research will appear in the leading research journal Astronomy and Astrophysics, and is titled \"On the massive stellar population of the Super Star Cluster Westerlund 1\", by J.S. Clark and colleagues. A second paper, \"Further Wolf-Rayet stars in the starburst cluster Westerlund 1\", by Ignacio Negueruela and Simon Clark will also be published in the same journal.  \"ESO's Telescopes Uncover Super Star Cluster in the Milky Way\" \u2014\u00a0ESO, March 22, 2005",

		   "text":"Tuesday, September 27, 2005\u00a0 gghhh Albert Einstein's best known equation, and probably the best known aspect of all physics, E=mc2, turns one hundred today. September 27, 1905 is generally considered the birthday of the equation because that is the day that Einstein's paper outlining the significance of the equation arrived in the offices of the German journal Annalen der Physik.  In the equation, 'E' stands for Energy, 'm' stands for mass, and 'c' stands for the speed of light. The equation shows that matter and energy are, essentially, two aspects of the same thing, and that a small amount of matter can be converted into an enormous amount of energy. Nuclear reactions, including fusion in the sun and in nuclear weapons, are examples of large amounts of energy released from the conversion of comparatively small quantities of mass. The United Nations declared 2005 the International Year of Physics in recognition of Albert Einstein's work in 1905. In addition to discovering his famous equation, over the course of 5 months in 1905 Einstein developed the theory of Special Relativity (which led him to the equation E=mc2), proved the existence of atoms and molecules, and showed that light is made of photons. 1905 is often called Einstein's annus mirabilis, or miracle year. The 100th anniversary of Einstein's miracle year is being celebrated in many countries around the world as the World Year of Physics. In the UK, it is called the Einstein Year.  \"World Year of Physics (USA)\" \u2014\u00a0American Physical Society, 2005 John S.

		   "text":"Friday, November 3, 2006\u00a0 gghhh      After hosting the United States gameshow The Price Is Right, Bob Barker has decided to call it quits and retire from being the gameshow's 35 year-long host. Barker plans to end the show in June of 2007. \"I will be 83 years old on December 12 ... and I've decided to retire while I'm still young,\" jokes Barker. Explaining why he has been on American televisions for over 50 years, Barker said \"I've gone on and on and on to this ancient age because I've enjoyed it.\" \"I'm just reaching the age where the constant effort to be there and do the show physically is a lot for me. I might be able to do the show another year, but better [to retire] a year too soon than a year too late,\" added Barker. Barker first started to host gameshows in 1956 when he hosted Truth or Consequences and started to host The Price is Right on September 4, 1972 where, to this day, he has been the gameshow's host. Barker is hinting the possibility of appearing in a few movies, but jokes around saying he will not appear in any \"nude scenes.\" \"I refuse to do nude scenes. These Hollywood producers want to capitalize on my obvious sexuality, but I don't want to be just another beautiful body,\" said Barker in a joking manner. CBS calls Barker a \"legend\" and an \"entertainment icon.\" The first thing he plans to do after retiring is \"sit down for maybe a couple of weeks and find out what it feels like to be bored,\" said Barker. \"Bob Barker is a daytime legend, an entertainment icon and one of the most beloved television personalities of our time,\" said Leslie Moonves, the chief executive of the CBS Network who also added that the network plans to do a special television show in Barker's honor, but Barker will not be saying a special goodbye to his viewers saying he will say what he always does at the end of every show; \"Help control the pet population. Have your pets spayed or neutered.\" \"From the bottom of my heart, I thank the television viewers, because they have made it possible for me to earn a living for 50 years doing something that I thoroughly enjoy. They have invited me into their homes daily for a half a century,\" said Barker.
